Summary:
The visualizations demonstrate the relationship between volatile acidity and citric acid, pH and citric acid levels,
free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide in terms of the overall quality of the red wine samples. The red wine 
data visualizations are derived from a dataset consisting of 1,599 samples of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" red wine.

Design

For the first chart, a horizontal bar graph was used to display the amount of red wine samples that received a 
quality score of either 3,4,5,6,7, or 8. The remaining scatter plots initially had circles that were displayed 
in a blue monochrome fashion. This was later changed after receiving feedback about making the data points a 
solid point. This would help improve the visibility of the sequential range of the blue hue that had the low 
quality with the lower hues and increased the darkness as the quality increased. The use of a monochrome color 
scheme was also implemented to make sure any potential person that has color blindness could effectively see my charts. 
Trend lines were also added for each of the resulting quality values. The legend was also renamed as Wine Quality 
and matches the color hue to its corresponding quality value. 
 
Feedback

Feedback 1:

Make the points on the scatter plot a solid color so the points can be differentiated easier by the different quality.

Feedback 2:
After you made the data points a solid color, it has allowed me to see much better the different quality values.
